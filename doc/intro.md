I am currently a PhD student of [the SIGMA Lab, University of Sydney](https://sigmalab-usyd.github.io/index.html), advised by Professor [Ouyang Wanli](https://wlouyang.github.io/) and Professor [Luping Zhou](https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/about/our-people/academic-staff/luping-zhou.html).

Before that, I was a research assistant at [the Centre for Perceptual and Interactive Intelligence (CPII)](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/research/innohk-centres/perceptual-and-interactive-intelligence.html), under the supervision of Professor [Dahua Lin](http://dahua.site/). I received a Bachelor of Engineering degree in Software Engineering from [Wuhan University](https://www.whu.edu.cn/). I also interned at the [SenseTime Research](https://www.sensetime.com/cn).

My research interests lie primarily in Self-Supervised Learning, AI for Science, and Computer Vision.
